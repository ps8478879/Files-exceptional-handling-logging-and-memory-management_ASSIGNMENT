        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Compiled languages are translated into machine code all at once before execution (e.g., C, C++), resulting in faster performance.\n",
        "Interpreted languages are executed line by line at runtime using an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript), making them easier to debug and more flexible, but generally slower than compiled languages.\n",

        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of a program is not interrupted. It uses the try, except, else, and finally blocks. When an error occurs in the try block, the program moves to the except block to handle the error gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "->The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is mainly used for cleanup operations such as closing files, releasing resources, or closing database connections. The code inside finally always runs after try and except.\n",

        "->Logging in Python is used to record messages about a program’s execution, such as errors, warnings, and informational events. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications by tracking what happens during runtime. Python provides the built-in logging module to log messages at different severity levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",

It is used to release resources such as closing files or network connections. However, its execution is not guaranteed immediately, so it should not be relied upon for critical cleanup tasks.\n",

Automatic memory allocation and garbage collection free unused objects, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than manual memory handling, especially in large and long-running applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Python’s garbage collection system automatically frees memory by removing objects that are no longer in use. It mainly uses reference counting, where an object is deleted when its reference count becomes zero. Additionally, Python has a cyclic garbage collector that detects and removes reference cycles, ensuring efficient memory management.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Closing a file in Python is important because it releases system resources, ensures that all data is properly written to the file, and prevents data corruption or memory leaks. It also avoids file-locking issues. Using the with statement automatically closes files, making file handling safer and more reliable.\n",
